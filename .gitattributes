# Git LFS tracking for large binary files
# Only track files that exceed GitHub's 50MB recommendation

# Large model files (89MB+)
*.bin filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Large Windows DLLs (70MB+)
*.dll filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Large executables (if any)
*.exe filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Note: .jar files are excluded from LFS as they are dependencies
# that should be managed via build tools (Maven/Gradle) or downloaded separately
